               <p>
                    Software is eating the world and we want our slice!  Unfortunately, coding school costs more than the crap cars we drive.  We be skimpin, we want to be pimpin.  We want to write the code that will change the world, educate the children, feed the hungry & enable the disabled… or just pay off our loans.  We can’t become the ballers/world changers we are destined to be without some maternal help.  We need YOU to make it rain like a mother, so we can invite you to our Silicon Valley mansions.  We are looking for difference makers like you to make our dreams come true.  YOU can make a difference.  Our future is in your hands.
               </p>
               <p>
                    You can contribute any amount you want, it’ll all make a difference. Check out our profiles & our plan to see who you are helping and how.
               </p>

               Because of YOU doing THIS!
